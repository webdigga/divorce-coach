## What is a Decree Absolute in the UK?

A Decree Absolute is the final legal document that officially ends a marriage or civil partnership in the UK. Issued by the court after a Decree Nisi (now called a Conditional Order), it confirms that the divorce or dissolution process is complete.

**Key Facts About the Decree Absolute:**

✔️ It marks the final stage of the divorce process.

✔️ Once granted, both parties are legally free to remarry.

✔️ You can apply at least six weeks and one day after receiving the Decree Nisi.

✔️ If you wait more than 12 months, the court may ask for an explanation.

## How to Apply for a Decree Absolute in the UK

**Step 1: Check Your Eligibility:**

✅ You must have a Decree Nisi (Conditional Order) from the court.

✅ At least 6 weeks and 1 day must have passed since the Decree Nisi was granted.

✅ If over 12 months have passed, you may need to explain the delay.

**Step 2: Complete the Application:**

✍️ Fill out Form D36 (Application for a Decree Absolute).

🖥️ If you applied for divorce online, you can submit your request via the HMCTS online portal.

**Step 3: Submit Your Application:**

📩 Send Form D36 to the same court that issued your Decree Nisi.

📲 If using the online divorce service, submit it digitally.

**Step 4: Wait for Court Approval:**

⏳ The court will review your application.

📆 Processing time is usually a few days to a few weeks.

**Step 5: Receive Your Decree Absolute:**

📜 Once approved, you will receive the official Decree Absolute certificate.

🏛️ This document confirms that your marriage or civil partnership is legally ended.

🔒 Keep it safe, as it may be required for legal matters such as remarrying or updating financial arrangements.
