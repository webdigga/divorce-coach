**Why does your business need to offer support?**

Domestic abuse inflicts profound physical and emotional wounds, manifesting in various forms such as physical, financial, emotional, and psychological abuse. Research underscores that a significant portion of domestic abuse victims are targeted even at their workplace, imposing adverse effects on both the abused individuals and their colleagues.

Crucially, the workplace often serves as a haven where victims can find respite from their abuser and seek the support they desperately need.

As an employer, your actions can be transformative and lifesaving. By fostering a supportive environment and implementing policies that address domestic abuse, you can offer vital assistance to those in need. Your proactive measures have the power to change and potentially save lives, providing hope and security to victims of domestic abuse.
