    highlightsListItem:
      - highlight: "Self-Importance: Narcissists often have an inflated sense of
          self-importance. They may exaggerate their achievements, talents, or
          abilities and expect constant admiration and praise from others."
      - highlight: "Lack of Empathy: Narcissists tend to have difficulty empathising
          with others and understanding their feelings. They may disregard or
          minimise the emotions and needs of others, focusing primarily on their
          own desires and concerns."
      - highlight: "Difficulty Maintaining Relationships: Narcissists may struggle to
          maintain healthy relationships due to their self-centeredness, lack of
          empathy, and manipulative behaviour. They may have a pattern of
          idealizing and devaluing others, leading to frequent conflicts and
          instability in relationships."
      - highlight: "Sense of Superiority: Narcissists often view themselves as superior
          to others and may look down on those they perceive as inferior. They
          may belittle or demean others to boost their own ego and assert
          dominance."
      - highlight: " Manipulative: Narcissists may use manipulation tactics, such as
          gaslighting, guilt-tripping, or love bombing, to control and
          manipulate others to get what they want."
  - title: Other common signs of Narcissist Behaviour to look out for
    highlightsListItem:
      - highlight: "Sense of Entitlement: Narcissists often believe they are entitled to
          special treatment or privileges without regard for the feelings or
          rights of others. They may expect others to cater to their needs and
          become angry or resentful when their expectations are not met."
      - highlight: " Lack of Accountability: Narcissists rarely take responsibility for
          their actions or mistakes. Instead, they may blame others for their
          problems or failures, make excuses, or deny any wrongdoing."
      - highlight: "Attention Seeking: Narcissists crave attention and validation from
          others and may go to great lengths to seek admiration and approval.
          They may become easily offended or feel threatened when they are not
          the centre of attention"
      - highlight: "Exploitation: Narcissists may exploit others for personal gain,
          whether it be financial, emotional, or social. They may use others to
          meet their needs without considering the well-being of those around
          them."
      - highlight: "Difficult Handling Criticism: Narcissists have fragile egos and
          maybe aggressive or defensive towards criticism. They may become
          angry, hostile, or dismissive when confronted with feedback that
          challenges their self-image."
