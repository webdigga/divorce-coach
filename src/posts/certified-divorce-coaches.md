## Finding the Right Coaching Programme

Choosing the right training programme is one of the most important decisions you'll make as an aspiring divorce coach. The programme you select will shape your skills, credibility, and career opportunities.

We've researched and evaluated various coaching programmes to help you make an informed decision. Here are our recommended providers.

## Why Coaching Accreditations Matter

When it comes to coaching, accreditation isn't optional - it's essential. Accredited programmes:

* Meet **industry-recognised professional standards**
* Enhance your **credibility** as a coach
* Count towards **CPD requirements**
* Provide **international recognition**
* Equip you with **specialist skills** to support clients through divorce and relationship breakdown

For that reason, we only recommend accredited training providers who meet these standards.
