## No-Fault Divorce: A Major Reform in UK Divorce Law

In April 2022, England and Wales introduced no-fault divorce, eliminating the need to assign blame when ending a marriage. This reform replaced the previous system, making the process less confrontational and allowing couples to focus on crucial matters like financial settlements, child arrangements, and property division.

## How Divorce Worked Before No-Fault Divorce

Before the reform, couples who wished to divorce in under two years had to assign blame to one spouse, even if they mutually agreed to separate. To prove that a marriage had irretrievably broken down, one of five legal grounds had to be cited:

**Unreasonable Behaviour** – One spouse had to provide examples of the other’s behaviour that made living together intolerable. The accused spouse did not have to admit to these claims.

**Adultery** – The accused had to admit to having sex with someone of the opposite sex outside of the marriage, or the other spouse needed to provide proof. Same-sex affairs were not legally considered adultery under the old system.

**Two Years of Separation** – If both spouses agreed to divorce, they had to live apart for at least two years before filing.

**Five Years of Separation** – If one spouse did not consent, the divorce could still proceed after five years of separation.

**Desertion** – One spouse had to prove they were abandoned by the other for at least two years without agreement.

## How No-Fault Divorce Changed the Process

The five reasons for divorce no longer apply. Now, couples can simply state that their marriage has irretrievably broken down without assigning blame. This change helps reduce conflict and allows both parties to move forward more amicably.
