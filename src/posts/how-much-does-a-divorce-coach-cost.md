## Typical Divorce Coach Session Rates

Most divorce coaches in the UK charge on a per-session basis, with sessions typically lasting 60 to 90 minutes. Rates vary depending on the coach's experience, qualifications, and location.

| Experience Level | Typical Rate Per Session | Session Length |
|-----------------|------------------------|----------------|

| Premium London-based coaches | £175 - £250+ | 60-90 minutes |

### What Affects the Price?

Several factors influence how much a divorce coach charges:

| Factor | Impact on Cost |
|--------|---------------|
| **Location** | London and Southeast coaches typically charge 20-30% more than those elsewhere in the UK |
| **Qualifications** | Coaches with ICF accreditation or specialist certifications may charge more |
| **Specialisation** | Niche expertise (high-net-worth divorces, narcissistic abuse, co-parenting) commands higher fees |
| **Experience** | More years of practice and a strong track record justify higher rates |
| **Format** | In-person sessions may cost more than online/video sessions |
| **Demand** | Coaches with full practices and waiting lists will charge more |

## Package Pricing: How Most Coaches Structure Their Fees

While some coaches offer pay-as-you-go sessions, many offer structured packages that provide better value and a more comprehensive programme of support.

| Package Type | Typical Cost | What's Usually Included |
|-------------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Single session** | £75 - £150 | One-off session, often used as an initial assessment |
| **3-session starter bundle** | £200 - £400 | Introduction to coaching, goal-setting, initial action plan |
| **6-session package** | £500 - £900 | Structured programme covering key areas of your divorce |
| **12-session programme** | £1,000 - £1,800 | Comprehensive support through the full divorce process |
| **Premium/VIP programme** | £2,000 - £3,000+ | Intensive support, priority access, additional resources |

### What's Typically Included Beyond the Sessions?

Good divorce coaching packages often include more than just face-to-face time:

- **Email or messaging support** between sessions
- **Worksheets and exercises** to complete between meetings
- **Resource packs** with guides, checklists, and templates
- **Emergency support calls** for urgent situations
- **Referrals** to solicitors, mediators, and other professionals
- **Post-programme check-ins** to review progress

## Divorce Coach Cost vs Other Professional Support

To put divorce coaching costs in context, here's how they compare to other forms of professional support during divorce:

| Professional | Typical Hourly/Session Rate | What They Do |
|-------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| **Divorce coach** | £75 - £200 | Practical guidance, emotional support, goal-setting, accountability |
| **Divorce solicitor** | £150 - £500+ | Legal advice, court representation, document preparation |
| **Family mediator** | £100 - £300 per session | Facilitates negotiation between both parties |
| **Counsellor/therapist** | £50 - £120 | Emotional processing, mental health support |
| **Financial advisor** | £150 - £300+ per hour | Financial planning, pension analysis, asset division |

### Key Difference

A divorce solicitor handles the **legal** process. A counsellor addresses **emotional healing**. A divorce coach bridges both worlds - helping you navigate the practical realities of divorce while building the emotional resilience to move forward. Many people work with a coach alongside a solicitor to keep legal costs down, because a well-prepared client needs less solicitor time.

## How Divorce Coaching Can Save You Money

While divorce coaching is an upfront cost, it can lead to significant savings elsewhere:

| How Coaching Saves Money | Typical Saving |
|-------------------------|---------------|
| **Reduced solicitor hours** | Being organised and emotionally prepared for meetings means fewer billable hours. Even 2-3 fewer solicitor hours saves £300-£1,500 |
| **Better decision-making** | Avoiding impulsive decisions driven by emotion can prevent costly legal battles |
| **Faster resolution** | Coaching helps you stay focused on outcomes, reducing the overall timeline of proceedings |
| **Avoiding court** | Coaches help you prepare for mediation, making settlement more likely and avoiding expensive court hearings |
| **Financial clarity** | Understanding your finances before meeting a solicitor means more efficient (and cheaper) legal advice |

The average cost of a contested divorce in the UK can exceed **£15,000-£30,000** in legal fees. If coaching helps you reach an amicable settlement even slightly faster, the return on investment is substantial.

## What Does a Typical Divorce Coaching Engagement Look Like?

Most clients work with a divorce coach for 6 to 12 sessions over a period of 3 to 6 months. Here's a typical journey and the associated costs:

| Phase | Sessions | Focus | Approximate Cost |
|-------|----------|-------|-----------------|
| **Initial assessment** | 1 | Understanding your situation, setting goals, creating an action plan | £75 - £150 |
| **Navigation phase** | 3-4 | Practical planning, preparing for solicitor meetings, managing emotions | £225 - £600 |
| **Transition phase** | 3-4 | Co-parenting arrangements, financial decisions, building independence | £225 - £600 |
| **Moving forward** | 2-3 | Post-divorce goals, new identity, future planning | £150 - £450 |
| **Total** | **9-12** | **Full divorce coaching programme** | **£675 - £1,800** |

## Certified Divorce Coach Cost in London

London-based coaches typically charge more due to higher operating costs and the cost of living in the capital. If you're looking for a **certified divorce coach in London**, expect:

| Service | London Price Range |
|---------|-------------------|
| Single session | £100 - £250 |
| 6-session package | £600 - £1,200 |
| 12-session programme | £1,200 - £2,500 |
| Premium programme | £2,500 - £5,000+ |

However, many London-based coaches now offer **online sessions** at the same or slightly reduced rates, giving you access to experienced coaches regardless of where you live in the UK.

## Free and Low-Cost Alternatives

If one-to-one coaching is beyond your budget, there are other options:

| Option | Cost | What You Get |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **[Breakup support groups](/breakup-support-groups/)** | Free - £30 per session | Group support, shared experiences, community |

| **Single coaching session** | £75 - £150 | One-off guidance on a specific issue |
| **Group coaching** | £30 - £50 per session | Coaching in a small group setting |

A single coaching session can be valuable even if you can't commit to a full programme. Many coaches offer an initial session to help you create an action plan you can follow independently.

## How to Choose a Divorce Coach (and Get Value for Money)

Not all coaches are equal. Here's what to look for to ensure your investment is worthwhile:

| What to Check | Why It Matters |
|--------------|---------------|
| **Certification** | A [certified divorce coach](/becoming-a-certified-divorce-coach/) has completed recognised training and met professional standards |
| **Specialisation** | A coach who specialises in divorce (not a general life coach) will understand the specific challenges you face |
| **Free consultation** | Most reputable coaches offer a free initial call so you can assess fit before committing |
| **Clear pricing** | Transparent fees with no hidden costs indicate a professional practice |
| **Testimonials** | Real client reviews and outcomes demonstrate the coach's effectiveness |
| **Accreditation** | Look for ICF, CPD, or other recognised coaching body accreditation |

## Is a Divorce Coach Worth the Cost?

The value of divorce coaching goes beyond the sessions themselves. Consider what's at stake:

| What's at Stake | How Coaching Helps |
|----------------|-------------------|
| **Your financial settlement** | Better preparation leads to fairer outcomes |
| **Your children's wellbeing** | Coaching helps you co-parent effectively during and after divorce |
| **Your mental health** | Structured support reduces anxiety, stress, and overwhelm |
| **Your career** | Staying functional and focused during divorce protects your professional life |
| **Your future** | Moving forward with clarity and confidence rather than bitterness and regret |

For most people, the cost of divorce coaching is a fraction of the overall cost of divorce - and it can be the difference between a difficult process that drags on for years and a managed transition that leads to a stronger future.
