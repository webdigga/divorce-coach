Whether you're looking to add a side hustle or dive into a rewarding new career, becoming a Breakup & Divorce Coach could be the perfect fit for you!

## Why Become a Breakup & Divorce Coach?

This rapidly growing field allows you to make a meaningful difference in people’s lives, guiding them through one of life’s toughest transitions—breakups and divorces. With a Breakup & Divorce Coach Practitioner qualification, you can offer emotional support, practical advice, and actionable strategies to those who are struggling to cope. And the best part? You can earn while making a positive impact.

Some coaches treat this as a part-time hustle, earning around £1,000 per month, while others have turned it into a full-time career, making £8,000 or more every month.
