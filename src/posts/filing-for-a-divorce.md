## How to Start the Divorce Process in the UK

Filing for a divorce and starting the divorce process can feel overwhelming, but understanding the process can make it more manageable. In most cases, you donâ€™t need a solicitor, as the application can be completed online.

## How to Apply for a Divorce

In the UK, you can start divorce proceedings through:

âœ… Online Application â€“ Submit your request via the UK Government website.

âœ… Postal Application â€“ Complete and send a D8 divorce form by mail.

Eligibility & Requirements:

* In the UK you must have been married for at least one year before applying
* A copy of your marriage certificate (original or certified) is required.
* The court fee is Â£593 (as of 2024), but financial help may be available for low-income applicants.

## Step-by-Step Guide to the Divorce Process

1. Submit the Divorce Application

* Either one spouse (sole application) or both spouses (joint application) can apply
* No need to assign blameâ€”simply state that the marriage has irretrievably broken down

2. Responding to the Application

* In sole applications, the respondent (other spouse) must acknowledge receipt
* For joint applications, this step is unnecessary

3. 20-Week Reflection Period

* Once the court accepts the application, a mandatory 20-week waiting period begins
* During this time, you can discuss financial settlements and child arrangements

4. Apply for a Conditional Order

* After 20 weeks, you can apply for a conditional order (previously called a decree nisi)
* This confirms that the court sees no legal reason to prevent the divorce

5. Apply for the Final Order

* At least six weeks after the conditional order, you can apply for a final order (formerly decree absolute)
* Once granted, your divorce is legally finalised

## How Long Does a Divorce Take?

The minimum time to complete a divorce in the UK is approximately six months, but it may take longer depending on:

* Case complexity
* Response time from both parties
* Court processing times

**Important:**

Divorce does not automatically resolve financial matters or child arrangements. These must be settled separately, either through mutual agreements or court orders.
