## Understanding the Distinction

If you're considering becoming a divorce coach, or simply trying to understand what divorce coaches do, one of the most common questions is: "How is divorce coaching different from counselling?"

While both professions support people through difficult times, they have distinct approaches, goals, and methods. Understanding these differences is essential for anyone considering a career in divorce coaching.

### The Core Difference: Focus and Direction

**Counselling** typically focuses on understanding the past—exploring how past experiences, trauma, and patterns affect current emotions and behaviours. Counsellors help clients process and heal from emotional wounds.

**Divorce Coaching** focuses on the present and future—helping clients navigate their current situation and move forward constructively. Coaches help clients set goals, make decisions, and take action.

| Aspect | Counselling | Divorce Coaching |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| Time focus | Past and present | Present and future |
| Primary goal | Healing and understanding | Action and progress |
| Approach | Therapeutic exploration | Goal-oriented guidance |
| Session style | Open-ended exploration | Structured and action-focused |
| Outcome | Emotional processing | Practical results |

### What Divorce Coaches Do

Divorce coaches help clients with practical and emotional aspects of separation, including:

**Decision Making**
- Clarifying priorities and values
- Weighing options objectively
- Making informed choices about the divorce process

**Practical Navigation**
- Understanding the divorce process
- Preparing for solicitor meetings
- Organising finances and documentation
- Creating co-parenting plans

**Emotional Management**
- Developing coping strategies
- Building resilience
- Managing stress and anxiety
- Maintaining focus during difficult moments

**Moving Forward**
- Setting post-divorce goals
- Building a new identity
- Creating a vision for the future
- Accountability and support

### What Counsellors Do

Counsellors (or therapists) help clients with deeper emotional processing, including:

**Therapeutic Exploration**
- Understanding why the marriage ended
- Processing grief and loss
- Exploring patterns from childhood or past relationships
- Working through trauma

**Mental Health Support**
- Addressing depression or anxiety
- Managing complex emotional responses
- Supporting those with mental health conditions
- Deeper psychological work

### When to Recommend Each

As a divorce coach, you'll need to understand when coaching is appropriate and when a client might benefit from counselling instead (or in addition to coaching).

**Divorce Coaching is ideal when a client:**
- Needs help navigating the practical aspects of divorce
- Wants to move forward but feels stuck
- Needs accountability and structure
- Is functioning well but needs support
- Wants to focus on goals and action

**Counselling may be more appropriate when a client:**
- Is experiencing severe depression or anxiety
- Has unresolved trauma affecting their ability to function
- Needs to process deep emotional wounds
- Has mental health conditions requiring clinical support
- Is unable to focus on the future due to past pain

**Many clients benefit from both**—working with a counsellor for deeper emotional work while using a coach for practical guidance and accountability.

### Training Differences

The training pathways for coaches and counsellors are quite different:

**Counselling Training:**
- Typically requires a degree-level qualification (2-4 years)
- Clinical supervision requirements
- Registration with professional bodies (BACP, UKCP)
- Focus on therapeutic techniques and mental health

**Divorce Coach Training:**
- Certificate programmes (typically 3-6 months)
- Focus on coaching methodologies and divorce-specific knowledge
- Accreditation through coaching bodies (ICF, CPD)
- Emphasis on practical skills and business development

### Why Choose Divorce Coaching as a Career?

For those considering a career change, divorce coaching offers several advantages:

**Shorter Training Path**
Become certified in months rather than years, while still making a meaningful difference.

**Growing Demand**
More people are recognising the value of specialised support during divorce.

**Flexibility**
Work around other commitments, set your own hours, and choose your clients.

**Personal Fulfilment**
Help people through one of life's most challenging transitions and see tangible results.

**Business Opportunity**
Build a practice that can provide substantial income while doing meaningful work.

### Is Divorce Coaching Right for You?

If you're considering becoming a divorce coach, ask yourself:

- Do you prefer focusing on solutions rather than analysing problems?
- Are you energised by helping people take action and see results?
- Do you want a career that offers flexibility and independence?
- Are you comfortable with the practical aspects of business development?
- Do you have life experience or skills that could benefit others?

If you answered yes to most of these questions, divorce coaching could be an excellent fit.
