In today's evolving workplace, more companies are recognising the need to offer specialised support for employees going through personal challenges including struggling with work and life after divorce.

## Why train to become a Divorce and Breakup Coach?

The opportunity has never been greater! Recent research from the Harvard Business Review reveals that breakups can reduce workplace productivity by up to 40%—not just for the year of the breakup, but for three years in total.
