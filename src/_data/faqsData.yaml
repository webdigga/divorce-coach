  - question: What Does a Divorce Coach Do?
    answer: A Divorce Coach is a trained and accredited professional who supports
      individuals going through a difficult divorce and/or breakup. Some coaches
      are also fully skilled and trained in helping people deal with a
      narcissist partner or are in a toxic relationship. Unlike a Divorce
      Lawyer, who focuses on the legal aspects, or a therapist, who addresses
      deeper mental health concerns, a Divorce Coach focuses on helping clients
      take back control and move on with their lives. This can also include
      managing intense emotions, co-parenting guidance, rebuilding
      self-confidence, regaining a sense of control and creating a clear path
      toward a new beginning. Many clients find the experience so transformative
      that they decide to become Certified Breakup & Divorce Coaches themselves
      — turning their own pain into purpose whilst building a rewarding,
      empowering new career.
